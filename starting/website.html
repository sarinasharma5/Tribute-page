      <h2>About Him</h2>
        <img src="about  .jpg" alt="">
      <p>Albert Einstein[a] (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German mathematician
         and physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity.With his passion for inquiry, 
         Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.</p>

      <h2>Major Achievements</h2>
      <ul>
        <img src="achievement.jpg" alt="">
        <li>Theory of Special Relativity (1905):</li>
           <p>In his 1905 paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” Einstein introduced the special theory of relativity. This theory revolutionized our understanding of space and 
            time by proposing that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.</p>

        <li>Photoelectric Effect (1905)</li>
           <p>In the same year as his special theory of relativity, 
            Einstein published another groundbreaking paper on the photoelectric effect. </p>


        <li> Theory of General Relativity (1915)</li>
          <p> on his special theory of relativity, Einstein developed the general theory of relativity,
             which is a theory of gravitation.</p>
        <li> Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc^2) (1905)</li>
        <p>In the same year as his other major contributions, Einstein formulated the 
          famous equation E=mc^2, where E represents energy, m represents mass, and 
          c represents the speed of light in a vacuum.</p>
      </ul>
